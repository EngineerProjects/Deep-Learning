### Core Element-wise Operations

1. **Basic Arithmetic Operations**
   - Addition (`__add__`, `__radd__`)
   - Subtraction (`__sub__`, `__rsub__`)
   - Multiplication (`__mul__`, `__rmul__`)
   - Division (`__truediv__`, `__rtruediv__`)
   - Floor division (`__floordiv__`, `__rfloordiv__`)
   - Modulo (`__mod__`, `__rmod__`)
   - Power (`__pow__`, `__rpow__`)
   - Negative (`__neg__`)
   - Positive (`__pos__`)
   - Absolute value (`__abs__`)

2. **In-place Versions of Arithmetic Operations**
   - `__iadd__` (+=)
   - `__isub__` (-=)
   - `__imul__` (*=)
   - `__itruediv__` (/=)
   - `__ifloordiv__` (//=)
   - `__imod__` (%=)
   - `__ipow__` (**=)

3. **Comparison Operations**
   - Equal to (`__eq__`)
   - Not equal to (`__ne__`)
   - Greater than (`__gt__`)
   - Greater than or equal to (`__ge__`)
   - Less than (`__lt__`)
   - Less than or equal to (`__le__`)

### Array Manipulation Methods

4. **Reshaping and Dimensionality**
   - `reshape(new_shape)` - Reshape array to new dimensions
   - `flatten()` - Convert to 1D array
   - `squeeze()` - Remove dimensions of size 1
   - `expand_dims(axis)` - Add a dimension at specified position
   - `transpose(*axes)` - Permute dimensions

5. **Indexing and Slicing**
   - `__getitem__` - For array[index] and array[start:end:step]
   - `__setitem__` - For array[index] = value
   - `take(indices, axis)` - Select elements along an axis

6. **Joining and Splitting**
   - `concatenate(other, axis)` - Join arrays along an axis
   - `split(sections, axis)` - Split array into sub-arrays
   - `stack(arrays, axis)` - Stack arrays along a new axis

### Broadcasting Mechanism

7. **Broadcasting**
   - `_broadcast_shapes(shape1, shape2)` - Determine output shape
   - Implementation in all element-wise operations
   - Support for operations between arrays of different shapes

### Basic Mathematical Operations

8. **Reduction Operations**
   - `sum(axis=None)` - Sum of array elements
   - `mean(axis=None)` - Mean of array elements
   - `min(axis=None)` - Minimum value
   - `max(axis=None)` - Maximum value
   - `argmin(axis=None)` - Index of minimum value
   - `argmax(axis=None)` - Index of maximum value

9. **Element-wise Math Functions**
   - `exp()` - Exponential
   - `log()` - Natural logarithm
   - `sqrt()` - Square root
   - `round(decimals=0)` - Round to given precision

### Type Conversions and Utility Methods

10. **Type-related Operations**
    - `astype(dtype)` - Convert to a different data type
    - `copy()` - Return a copy of the array

11. **Utility Methods**
    - `fill(value)` - Fill array with a constant value
    - `clip(min, max)` - Limit values to given range
    - `all()` - Test if all elements are non-zero
    - `any()` - Test if any element is non-zero

### Implementation Approach

When implementing these operations, it's important to consider:

1. **Dimensional Independence**: Most operations should work regardless of the array's dimensions, making them reusable for vectors, matrices, and tensors.

2. **Broadcasting**: This is a powerful concept that allows operations between arrays of different shapes. Implementing it correctly in your base class will save a lot of code duplication.

3. **Type Handling**: Ensure operations properly handle different data types, especially when operating between arrays of different types.

4. **Special Cases**: Handle edge cases like empty arrays, scalars, and operations that might change dimensions.

The core idea behind this approach is that your Vector, Matrix, and Tensor subclasses will inherit all these fundamental operations, and then add their specialized methods. For example, Matrix will add determinant() and inverse(), while Vector will add norm() and dot_product() methods.

By implementing these operations thoroughly in your NArray base class, you'll have a solid foundation for your hybrid approach. Your specialized subclasses can then focus on the operations that truly make sense only for their specific dimensionality, resulting in a clean, logical API that balances generality with specialization.
